## Usage

> Once the application is up and running on Xcode's iOS simulator, simply follow the on-boarding process to get started.

## Requirements

- Node 4.4.0
- npm 3.8.1
- Xcode 7.3

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install
```
Once all dependencies are finished installing:

```sh
react-native start
react-native run-ios
```
React Native makes it incredibly easy to develop as you would in a web browser. When any changes are made, simply hit `CMD + R` (on Mac) to reload the simulator with your changes.
